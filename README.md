# GoPhish
Compile of GoPhish with the Latest Features

This is a compile of GoPhish that works on 64 bit Linux. The original authors had good features like templates in Microsoft Office attachments but did not provide a binary for it, expecting users to be able to compile GoPhish on their own. Unfortunately, not all users are coders, so here's the binary for your use. Just replace the gophish executable with this one after you download the binary from the original project at https://getgophish.com/.

If you do simple newsletters, GoPhish can act as a simple email campaign tool. There are limited features; you can only personalise your firstname, lastname and 1 extra field for emails. If you're a coder, you probably be able to extend this to more fields.

Found it useful for my needs, so this is my contribution to current and future GoPhish users.
